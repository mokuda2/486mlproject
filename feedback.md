Steven:
He said he liked the visualizations done from the resource with EDA.  As far as analysis, he suggested doing something with SVM by comparing two types.  At that point in the project, I was still in the middle of implementing the different models when I planned on doing KNN, decision trees, random forests, and an ensemble of those three.

Jackson:
I really like the analysis on the Pokemons and how its broken up. I was confused at first about why you divided stats so maybe an explanation about why the division on the graphs would help!

Later feedback from Steven:
I didnâ€™t see anything that was unclear or vague. I think you took great care in accurate reporting of the models. The graphs and charts fit perfectly and it all looks great. I'm very impressed with the analysis. It looks great and came together nicely.
